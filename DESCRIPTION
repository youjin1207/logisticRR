Description: Adjusted odds ratio conditional on potential confounders can be directly obtained from logistic regression. However, those adjusted odds ratios have been widely incorrectly interpreted as a relative risk. As relative risk is often of interest in public health, we provide a simple code to return adjusted relative risks from logistic regression model under potential confounders.
